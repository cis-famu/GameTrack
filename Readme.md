## **About the Project**
Welcome to GameTracker, an application designed to enhance your gaming experience by allowing you to track the video games you play or watch. This app connects individuals based on their gaming preferences, creating a community where users can share their experiences, thoughts, and recommendations.


## **Milestones**

## **Milestones 1**

In this milestone, we formalize our project idea by creating our project charter and conducting a SWOT analysis. We also create our high-level budget and time estimates.

## **Milestones 2**

In this milestone, we continue with planning activities. We outline our tasks using a work breakdown structure, network diagram, and Gantt chart. We begin to document user requirements by creating a detailed requirements list and use cases. We also evaluate similar systems and highlight external APIs that will be integrated.

## **Milestones 3**
In this milestone, the group will advance to the project's design phase, focusing on refining the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) by developing Context, Level-0, and Level-1 diagrams. Simultaneously, initiate the Request for Quotation (RFQ) process for an essential project element and create a style guide. Develop an interactive wireframe in Figma, aligning with the style guide, and record a GIF for GitHub. Additionally, craft a marketing flyer highlighting app features, benefits, and screen visuals for comprehensive documentation.

Additionally, craft a marketing flyer highlighting app features, benefits, and screen visuals for comprehensive documentation.

After the design phase, each group member should contribute to the Lessons-Learned report, reflecting on insights gained during the project's design and suggesting improvements for future endeavors. Alongside this, finalize the Poster Presentation and Pre-Recorded Video for the CIS Expo, ensuring a comprehensive showcase of the project's design and key components.
